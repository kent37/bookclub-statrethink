### Exercises Hard 1 - Hard 3

**Solutions by Kent Johnson**

Suppose there are two equally common species of panda bear. Species A gives birth to twins 10% of the time, otherwise birthing a single infant. Species B births twins 20% of the time, otherwise birthing singleton infants.

#### 2H2: Suppose a female panda of unknown species has just given birth to twins. What is the probability that she is from species A?

The likelihood of birthing twins for each species:
$$Pr(twins|A) = 0.1$$
$$Pr(twins|B) = 0.2$$

The prior probability that a panda is species A or B:
$$Pr(A) = Pr(B) = 0.5$$

The average likelihood of twins is the weighted average of the individual
likelihoods. This will be the denominator in Bayes theorem:
$$Pr(twins)
  = Pr(twins|A) * Pr(A) + Pr(twins|B) * Pr(B) \\
  = 0.1 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 \\
  = 0.15$$

Bayes theorem gives the posterior probability of A or B given the
birth of twins:
$$Pr(A|twins) = Pr(twins|A) * Pr(A) / Pr(twins) \\
  = (0.1 * 0.5) / 0.15 \\
  = 1/3$$

$$Pr(B|twins) = Pr(twins|B) * Pr(B) / Pr(twins) \\
  = (0.2 * 0.5) / 0.15 \\
  = 2/3$$

#### 2H1: What is the probability that her next birth will also be twins?

The posterior probabilities $Pr(A|twins)$ and $Pr(B|twins)$ from **2H2**
become the prior probabilities for this question. 
We are asked for the overall probability
of twins, this is the weighted average of the probabilities for each species.

$$Pr(second twin|twins) \\
  = Pr(twins|A) * Pr(A|twins) + Pr(twins|B) * Pr(B|twins) \\
  = 0.1 * (1/3) + 0.2 * (2/3) \\
  = 0.17$$

These results make sense intuitively--B's are twice as likely to have twins,
so having twins makes them twice as likely to be a B, and moves the probability
of twins in the next birth two-thirds of the way from 
$Pr(twins|A)$ to $Pr(twins|B)$.

#### 2H3: Suppose the same panda mother has a second birth and that it is a singleton infant. Compute the posterior probability that this panda is species A.

Again, the posterior from problem **2H2** becomes the prior
probability of A or B.

Bayes theorem says
$$Pr(A|single_twin) = Pr(single|A) * Pr(A|twin) / Pr(single|twin)$$

The denominator is the average likelihood of single birth given a prior twin birth:
$$Pr(single|twin) = Pr(single|A) * Pr(A|twin) + Pr(single|B) * Pr(B|twin) \\
  = 0.9 * (1/3) + 0.8 * (2/3) \\
  = 0.833$$

Substituting:
$$Pr(A|single_twin) 
  = (0.9 * (1/3)) / 0.833 
  = 0.36$$

Check: $Pr(A|single_twin)$ should be smaller than $Pr(A|single)$ because
the twin birth pushes the probability towards B.
$$Pr(A|single) = Pr(single|A) * Pr(A) / Pr(single) \\
  = (0.9 * 0.5) / 0.85 \\
  = 0.53$$

Notice that observing a twin birth changes the posterior much more than
observing a single birth. Twin births are rare and have very different
probabilities, so they affect the posterior strongly. Single births are
common and have similar probabilities, so they don't affect the posterior
much.
